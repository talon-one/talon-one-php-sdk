------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**profileId** | **string** | ID of the customer profile set by your integration layer.  **Note:** If the customer does not yet have a known &#x60;profileId&#x60;, we recommend you use a guest &#x60;profileId&#x60;. | [optional]

**evaluableCampaignIds** | **int[]** | When using the &#x60;dry&#x60; query parameter, use this property to list the campaign to be evaluated by the Rule Engine.

**attributes** | **object** | Arbitrary additional JSON properties associated with the event. They must be created in the Campaign Manager before setting them with this property. See [creating custom attributes](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/account/dev-tools/managing-attributes#creating-a-custom-attribute). | [optional]
